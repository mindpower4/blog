<h1>What's the Best VPN Service for China Nowadays?</h1>

<p>When your computer connects to the internet, its public IP address is displayed openly. Virtual private networks (VPNs) provide data security by creating encrypted tunnels to shield your IP information. This is accomplished through the use of a government encryption device or through a VPN server.

Commercial vendors utilize the latter to make VPNs possible for their customers. Today there are 300 VPN companies that supply services to customers around the world.

VPNs make it possible to cross national boundaries and access services that would otherwise be unaccesable. In this context, let’s say you’re living in another country, and you’re trying to access a streaming service such as Netflix, you will be able to use a VPN service to view movies within the comfort of your home.</p>

<h2>Here are some things to keep in mind when looking for a VPN: </h2>

<p>VPNs should be able to service multiple devices, which means that they can support anything that runs  Windows, Apple, Android or iOS operating systems. You will also want to check how many devices your VPN service can connect at once. You will also need to determine if your system is secure once the VPN is active. 

The user interface is another important factor to consider when choosing the right VPN. Nobody likes a clunky non-user friendly GUI that is difficult to navigate through. 

VPNs also have numerous servers around the world, so if you plan to move, you will want a service that provides as much coverage as possible to ensure complete privacy and security. Major vendors such as ExpressVPN and NordVPN have servers that are distributed worldwide to service their client base.

Ideally, your prospective VPN should offer a reliable customer service desk to help troubleshoot your program in case you run into any problems. 

When you figured out which VPN you want to buy, figure out a payment plan based on how much you can afford. VPNs are subscription-driven and can be expensive if you’re only doing monthly plans. Some vendors provide long-term subscriptions via semi-yearly to yearly discounts. 

If you’re not satisfied with the service you’re receiving from your VPN, make sure that the vendor offers a money-back guarantee. The end state is to choose one that works best for your needs. </p>


<h2>Why VPNs have become essential</h2>

<p>Because of the increased frequency and severity of cyber attacks, VPNs have become essential to providing privacy and security for those willing to pay for it. The security aspect is especially important since we live in an era of social media where data is exchanged frequently. Because of the fact that our computer networks are heavily interconnected with one another, this interconnection opens up pathways that lead to numerous vulnerabilities exploited by hostile actors with malicious intent. 

Cyber crimes are expected to go up this year, as well as 2021, estimated to be $6 billion in damages. Small businesses can be easily targeted with cyberattacks because they lack the necessary defenses to keep themselves protected from dangerous software. 

Laptops, iPads, tablets and other portable machines have taken the place of regular PC desktops. Because of their portability, this makes them likely targets of cyber attacks since users tend to not be security-conscious and utilize public wifi connections because of the convenience of being able to connect to the internet with ease. The ability to work remotely resulted in the expansion of the gig market and greater mobility for those looking to do work outside of the office.  

You might be asking yourself: why the hell are VPNs so popular? Just like antivirus or other security-oriented solutions, VPNs are designed to give clients piece of mind so they can go about their business. 
Tech corporations such as Symantec and McAfee have included VPNs as part of the software packages to provide data protection for their client base. 

Originally, VPN services tended to be slow in previous years. Today, that is no longer the case, as advancements have been made to VPN tech, such as VPLS (virtual private LAN service) and L2TP (layer 2 tunneling protocols). These improvements are an illustration of the market’s confidence in VPN when it comes to security and encryption options.  

It may be tempting to not purchase a VPN service as an attempt to cut costs. This is not advisable, as the nature of cyber attacks make them a serious threat to data destruction, denial or theft. When VPNs are coupled with other security solutions like firewalls and antivirus suites, together they provide the perfect means of providing security without sacrificing convenience. 

There is no question that when you use a VPN service, you will get your money’s worth. The level of protection it provides for your company as well as your own personal data is invaluable. </p>


<h2>What is VPN obfuscation?</h2>

<p>VPN obfuscation is a fancy term for shielding data that goes from one point to another from prying eyes. This method helps to overcome government-placed blocks meant to censor online content.
Synonymous terms that come to mind in relation to obfuscation are words like ‘stealth mode’, ‘stealth VPN’ or ‘cloaking technology’. 

These are not mere science fiction definitions, these are words that provide context for your internet traffic. Data that transits between destinations are shielded as regular HTTPS traffic, where government and internet service providers will be unable to distinguish between legitimate traffic versus VPN traffic.

Obfuscation removes the metadata tied to your VPN traffic.. VPN obfuscation works by double encryption, where data is sent through two servers instead of one. The purpose of the secondary server is to misdirect unwanted visitors from intercepting or viewing your data. 

By nature VPNs obscure traffic from outside entities to prevent them from peering into your personal data. This includes any form of personal identifying information (PII) such as your social security number, internet and shopping history. 

Obfuscated servers can bypass restrictions such as firewalls, and can be utilized in countries that have restricted internet access. 

Your data also isn’t capped when VPN obfuscation comes into play. ISPs tend to put a cap on data rates as a quality control measure whenever they see you’re visiting specific websites, streaming videos or downloading content into your device. They can also indiscriminately throttle VPN traffic as a means of maintaining the cap.  

Below is a small listing of vendors on the market that offer obfuscation: 

<strong>1. ExpressVPN:</strong> A fast and reliable company that offers robust service and is able to defeat Chinese internet restrictions and any other countries with strict internet control policies.

<strong>2. NordVPN:</strong> This is another top-tier provider able to bypass Chinese VPN blocks with little to no difficulty.

<strong>3. VyprVPN:</strong> Utilizing the Chameleon protocol, this VPN vendor helps hide your internet traffic in a fast and reliable manner. <p>


<h2>The Great Firewall of China (GFW)</h2>

<p>The GFW (also known as the Golden Shield) is a technological initiative by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to regulate internet traffic within the boundaries of China as well as traffic outside of the country’s boundaries and serves as an analogy to the Great Wall. While cyber laws have been prevalent since the 1970s, China did not have any form of legislation pertaining to internet regulations until 1997. The GFW initiative utilizes different methods to block traffic and is heavily regulated under the control of the Communist party. 

The key methods that enable this ability include black hole IP range bans, DNS spoofing/filtering/redirection, transparent proxies that utilize URL filtering, man-in-the-middle attacks, packet forging and quality of service filtering. All of them have effectively managed to control the Chinese population through the use of propaganda and obscuring the truth. While methods differ between Chinese ISPs, they all utilize these blocks in order to enforce PRC cyber law. 

It was conceived as a response to fears within the Communist party that the internet can spread propaganda in opposition to their rule of China. Commonly used apps such as Twitter, Wikipedia, YouTube, WhatsApp and Facebook are blocked to prevent users from accessing them due to the mechanisms embedded with the Great Firewall. When you account that China holds 1.4 billion people within its borders, that’s a lot of people that are being denied access to the public internet that the rest of the world already has. 

The argument is that the CCP wishes to control its portion of the internet space as a means of protecting its national security and sovereignty. In all honesty, China’s method is a means of asserting cyber controls in rather dictatorial fashion. The country has already showcased its ability to apply pressure to private companies such as Blizzard Entertainment and the NBA for trying to speak out against the protests in Hong Kong. 

This form of intimidation have caught the ire of the international public along with criticisms from Western governments. 
In addition to the Great Firewall, the PRC has access to another internet-based technology dubbed the Great Cannon. The Great Cannon utilizes public Chinese internet connections and weaponizes them to inject Javascript codes through unsecure HTTP requests. Whenever visitors come to insecure sites, the end result is that their browsers will download this malicious code and send additional traffic outside the Great Firewall, creating additional traffic that significantly slows down website navigation or ceases functionality altogether. 

While blockade makes it difficult to access information outside of China, Chinese citizens are still able to access blocked websites by using VPN services. The risk of arrest is real, as people have been arrested for illegally distributing VPN software that tunnels through the firewall. This form of oppressive control is all the more reason why people should use a VPN. 

If you intend to go to China, there are some things you need to be aware of before you travel there: 

-	While VPNs can be used, it would be advisable for you to download the service beforehand. VPNs are a means of being able to access information securely and anonymously without getting caught.  
-	Figure out which VPN you want to use first. The more servers that it has, the better.
-	Ensure the service offers robust security, even if the connection drops. If even a slight trace of your IP information is given away, that is a bad sign. Obfuscation is a definitive must in this regard. </p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, ExpressVPN has established itself as one of the leading virtual private networks. They are also the most trusted and reliable VPN i have come across and the network speed is similar to your default connection.
However, it can be more difficult if you are currently living under the communist party or planning to spend some time there. 
As ExpressVPN is a well known brand and the wall started blocking some of their servers recently, i will not recommend them to anyone who relies on a stable vpn connection within the country.
