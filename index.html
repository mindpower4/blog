<h1>Best VPN Services for China Reviewed 2020</h1>

<p>Generally speaking, ExpressVPN has established itself as one of the leading virtual private networks. 
They are also the most trusted and reliable VPN i have come across and the network speed is similar to your default connection.
However, it can be more difficult if you are currently living under the communist party or planning to spend some time there. 
As ExpressVPN is a well known brand and the wall started blocking some of their servers recently, i will not recommend them to anyone who relies on a stable vpn connection within the country.
